## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
I used this project to improve my SCSS and responsive navbar skills. 
I made sure the website is fully responsive.

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
``` -->
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  transform: translate;
  transform : skew;
  transform: scale; 
  transform; rotate;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  navLink.forEach (n => n.addEventListener('click' , closeMenu))
}
```


### Continued development

I want to focus on perfecting my responsive navbar and Javascript skills. Improving SCSS too.
